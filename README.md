__Dear Contributors__,

welcome and thank you for visiting the Human Connection Github Site. 
We are a small team, but with a great idea to develop a network that will serve the people.

Human Connection is an upcoming, new generation social network focused on local and global positive change. The collaborative platform is designed to promote the sharing of useful news, ideas, causes and values as well as smart know-how and experiences that can benefit everyone and meet mankindÂ´s needs.
